# RCIG Coordination Repo

This repository will be for the Rust Cryptography Interest Group to store meeting 
minutes from Sync-Up calls, open issues based on ongoing discussions, suggest follow 
up topics of discussion for future sync-up calls and mainly be a place where the community 
coordinates. 
The aim will be for this repo to evolve an archive and a place where actionable items can be 
picked up easily by members of the RCIG community.
